{% info %}
The endpoints and features described in IP Management docs are
only available if you have dedicated IPs for your account.
To add more IPs to your account, please click the "Add a Dedicated IP" button on the [Plan & Billing Details](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/billing) page.
{% endinfo %}

Using the IP Management API methods, you can create [IP pools]({{root_url}}/API_Reference/Web_API_v3/IP_Management/ip_pools.html), assign
[IP addresses]({{root_url}}/API_Reference/Web_API_v3/IP_Management/ip_addresses.html) to them, and enable [IP warmup]({{root_url}}/API_Reference/Web_API_v3/IP_Management/ip_warmup.html) for the pools
and IP addresses you've created.
