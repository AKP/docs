Marketing Campaigns Contacts
{% endanchor %}

The Contacts page in Marketing Campaigns has been updated to improve the user experience! The UI has been simplified to make adding contacts more streamlined and easy-to-use. For more information, see the [documentation] (https://sendgrid.com/docs/User_Guide/Marketing_Campaigns/contacts.html).

{% anchor h3 %}
Substitution tag update
{% endanchor %}

Substitution tags are no longer case sensitive in the email content. Previously, the substitution tag in your email content had to exactly match the substitution tag. For example, if you have the substitution tag `[%panda%]`, and your email content says `"hello [%PANda%], buy my bamboo"`, the substitution tag for `[%panda%]` is now applied.

Legacy Newsletter
{% endanchor %}

Legacy Newsletter has been sunset and can no longer be used to build or send campaigns. In order to continue sending marketing emails, SendGrid recommends switching to [Marketing Campaigns](https://sendgrid.com/docs/User_Guide/Marketing_Campaigns/index.html). See the [documentation](https://sendgrid.com/docs/User_Guide/Legacy_Newsletter/index.html) for more information on why we made the switch.

New editing experience
{% endanchor %}

The editing experience has been updated to offer [a better user experience](https://sendgrid.com/blog/taking-the-pain-out-of-email-design-and-editing/) when creating email campaigns or templates. Whether using marketing or transactional templates, you can choose between:

A powerful, marketer-friendly code editor with:
- Split-screen editing so you can see your HTML changes in a live preview
- Scroll syncing so you can easily pinpoint the HTML element you wish to edit
- Syntax highlighting, code completion, and error flagging for efficient coding
- 100% protection from unwanted HTML changes to keep your design pixel perfect

Or a flexible design editor that still offers HTML options:
- Smooth drag & drop editing with handy WYSIWYG formatting so you can work quickly
- Access to edit the HTML of individual modules with confidence, or drag in a custom code module
- Advanced options to edit the HTML head to add global styles or tracking
- Option to export the HTML of your entire email, or import custom code

{% anchor h3 %}
Dedicated IP price increase
{% endanchor %}

We increased the monthly price for purchasing additional dedicated IPs from $20 to $30. If you already own dedicated IPs, this price change does not affect what you pay each month for the dedicated IPs you already own — that price remains at $20. We’re making the change to the price for newly-purchased dedicated IPs to better reflect our cost to source and maintain those IPs, and the value of those IPs for our customers.

{% anchor h3 %}
Code library release notifications
{% endanchor %}

We now allow followers of our libraries to subscribe to release notifications. [Subscribe](https://dx.sendgrid.com/newsletter/all) from each of our GitHub Library READMEs. Signing up is as simple as checking a box and entering your info.

{% anchor h3 %}
Increased character limit for text custom fields
{% endanchor %}

You can now include up to 32,000 characters in text custom fields. This is useful particularly for senders who may be passing URLs or custom content via custom fields.

{% endanchor %}

{% anchor h3 %}
Responsive image enhancements
{% endanchor %}

Images are now responsive to the container they’re held within, as opposed to being a percent of their original size.

{% anchor h3 %}
Additional fonts available for campaigns and templates
{% endanchor %}

Additional standard web fonts are now available, including Arial Black, Bookman Old Style, Courier, Garamond, Impact, Palatino, and Times.

Experiments tab and Experiments overview
{% endanchor %}

The introduction of these experiments gives you the opportunity to shape the future of SendGrid’s platform with your valuable feedback.

IP self service purchase
{% endanchor %}

If you’re using SendGrid’s Pro and Premier pricing plan, you can now purchase up to 3 dedicated IP addresses per month through the user interface, and assign your purchased IPs to subusers. You also now have an IP Addresses page in the Settings section of your UI, so you can view all of your dedicated IPs, their warmup status, and when they were added.

{% anchor h3 %}
Increased photo limits
{% endanchor %}

You can now store up to 1,500 images for use in templates, up from 1,000 previously.

{% anchor h3 %}
Teammates
{% endanchor %}

Teammates expands our existing permissions for multiple credentialed users, and adds a layer of UI to make it easy for you to add your colleagues to your account. Teammate-level credentials allow account owners to limit teammates to read-only views, limit their access to only those areas they need to see, or give them access to secure areas to manage specific features, such as API keys.

Magento 2 extension
{% endanchor %}

The SendGrid extension for Magento 2.0 makes it easy to ensure delivery of your most important transactional emails. [SendGrid for Magento 2.0](https://sendgrid.com/docs/Integrate/Partners/magento.html) allows you to choose between the SMTP relay or the Email API to send outgoing emails from your Magento installation.

{% anchor h2 %}

{% anchor h3 %}
Signup security enhancements
{% endanchor %}

We’ve added several new protections that further enhance security at the account sign-up stage, including those that better detect and block would-be spammers.

{% anchor h3 %}
Interactive v3 API documentation{% endanchor %}

For developers creating and monitoring an integration with the SendGrid API, the new interactive [v3 API documentation](https://sendgrid.com/docs/API_Reference/api_v3.html) is easier to use and expedites end-to-end integration time. You can now call every endpoint in the API directly from the browser, so you can see your data in the requests and responses before you write a single line of code. Then, when you’re ready to start testing code, you can copy/paste the code from the call you just made from the “Try It” page. All of these features, including contextual search and clear as well as color-coordinated formatting, allow for easy scanning and quick solution identification.

{% anchor h3 %}
New C# library supporting .NET Core
{% endanchor %}

Microsoft is moving towards .NET Core and we have decided to make sure our C# library is ready when and if you decide to start rewriting your code. Our new library is .NET Standard 1.3 compliant, so that our library works with C# 4.5.2 and up.

{% anchor h3 %}
Improved contact search
{% endanchor %}

You can now use approximate search terms to find contacts, rather than having to have an exact name or email address.

{% anchor h3 %}
Billing and invoice usability improvements
{% endanchor %}

To ease the customer process for paying invoices, we’re introducing an unpaid billing invoice alert banner and a retry credit card button in the billing page of the UI.

{% anchor h3 %}
Universal links and partnership with Branch
{% endanchor %}

You can now maximize customer engagement by streamlining your SendGrid email with your mobile app experience using Branch’s implementation of SendGrid’s universal links. Universal links (also known as deep links) allow senders to link directly into their mobile apps from email, while maintaining click tracking functionality. We partnered with Branch to offer easy setup and ongoing support requirements for universal links.

{% anchor h3 %}
Segment on relative dates
{% endanchor %}

You can now create dynamic segments based on relative dates using "is before," is after," or "Is within." For example, to create a segment of all recipients who have opened an email within 30 days, define a segment as Condition: “Last Opened” Criteria: “is within” Number of days: 30”
