[Lists]({{root_url}}/User_Guide/Marketing_Campaigns/lists.html) are simply static collections of Marketing Campaigns contacts. By default, the ALL CONTACTS section stores any new contacts you add. You may create new lists when adding contacts either manually, or when uploading a CSV (comma separated values) file. When you send an email campaign, you can add contact lists to the specific recipient segments you wish to target.

For more information about Lists, please see our [User Guide]({{root_url}}/User_Guide/Marketing_Campaigns/lists.html).
