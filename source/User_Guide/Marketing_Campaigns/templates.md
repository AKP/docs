Marketing Campaigns templates determine how the content of your campaign will be built and displayed to your recipients. Templates also serve as a quick starting point for future campaigns by saving you time from having to rebuild your campaign's layout. Consequently, templates allow you to reuse content and maintain brand consistency across all of your campaign efforts.

We provide a collection of pre-built, responsive templates that you may begin using and customizing immediately, or you can create your own template from scratch.

To view your templates, click **Marketing Campaigns** in the left hand navigation menu and select **Templates**.

{% anchor h2 %}
Create New Template
{% endanchor %}

To create a new template from scratch, click the **Create New Template** button. This will take you to the design editor with a blank template that you can build and customize to suit your needs.
