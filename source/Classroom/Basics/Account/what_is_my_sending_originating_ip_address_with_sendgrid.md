# Do I have a dedicated IP?

Depending on the plan you have chosen, you either have a dedicated sending IP address or you are using a shared sending IP address.

- All Pro and Premier customers are given at least one dedicated sending IP by default. You can view any IPs attached to your account [here](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/ip_addresses).
- Free and Essential customers send from groups of shared IP addresses, where they are grouped with senders of similar reputation and deliverability. Shared IPs addresses that these accounts send from can change without notice as your reputation changes, or as we make changes to IP groups to improve deliverability. In theses cases, you will not be able to view your shared sending IP addresses from within your account.

To see your dedicated IPs, you may [view them here](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/ip_addresses).
